# Inertia {#inertia}

Focusing on distances among all pairs of objects implicitly entails taking into account the __dispersion__ or spread (i.e. variation) of the data.

The reason to pay attention to distances and dispersion is to summarize in a quantitative way the configuration of the data points. In this chapter, you will learn about _Inertia_, which is another measure to quantify the amount of variation in a data set.


## The concept of Inertia

Consider three individuals and its centroid:

```{r fig.cap='Dispersion 1', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/spread_square_dist1.png")
```

Given a cloud of points, how can we measure how spread out is thie cloud? In other words, how can we measure the amount of spread in the data?

One way to consider the dispersion of data (in a mathematical form) is by adding the squared distances among all pairs of points.

```{r fig.cap='Dispersion 2', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/spread_square_dist2.png")
```

$$
\text{SSD} = 2 d^2(\text{Luke}, \text{Anakin}) + 2 d^2(\text{Luke}, \text{Yoda}) + 2 d^2(\text{Anakin}, \text{Yoda})
$$


Another way to measure the dispersion of data is by considering the squared distances of all points around the center of gravity (i.e. centroid)  $\mathbf{g}$ which is the _average_ individual.

The total dispersion, measured by SSD, can also be calculated as: $2n$ times the sum of squared distances with respect to the centroid $\mathbf{g}$:

```{r fig.cap='Dispersion 3', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/spread_square_dist3.png")
```

$$
\text{SSD} = (2 \times 3) \times \{ d^2(\text{Luke}, \mathbf{g}) + d^2(\text{Anakin}, \mathbf{g}) + d^2(\text{Yoda}, \mathbf{g}) \}
$$

```{r fig.cap='Dispersion 4', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/spread_square_dist4.png")
```

One way to take into account the dispersion of the data is with the concept of 
__Inertia__.

- Inertia is a term borrowed from the _moment of inertia_ in mechanics (physics).
- This involves thinking about data as a rigid body (i.e. particles).
- We use the term Inertia to convey the idea of dispersion in the data.
- In multivariate methods, the term Inertia generalizes the notion of variance.
- Think of Inertia as a "multidimensional variance".




## Inertia of a cloud of Poitns

Now let's consider a cloud of points associated to a data set of $n$ individuals on which $p$ variables have been measured:

```{r fig.cap='Cloud 1', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/cloud_inertia1.png")
```

The Total Inertia, $I$, is a weighted sum of squared distances among all pairs of individuals:

$$
I = \frac{1}{2n^2} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\sum_{h = 1}^{n}{d^2(i,h)}}
$$

Equivalently, the Total Inertia can be calculated in terms of the centoid $\mathbf{g}$:

```{r fig.cap='Cloud 2', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/cloud_inertia2.png")
```



$$
I = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{d^2(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{g})}
$$

In this sense the Inertia is an average sum of squared distances around the centroid $\mathbf{g}$.

When working with mean-centered data, then the centroid $\mathbf{g}$ becomes the origin of the cloud of points:

```{r fig.cap='Cloud 3', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dispersion/cloud_inertia3.png")
```

\begin{align*}
Inertia &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i d^2(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{g}) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} (\mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{g})^{\mathsf{T}}(\mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{g}) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} tr(\mathbf{X^\mathsf{T} X}) \\
& = \frac{1}{n} tr(\mathbf{X X^\mathsf{T}})
\end{align*}

where $m_i$ is the mass (i.e. weight) of individual $i$, usually $1/n$
