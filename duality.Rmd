# (PART) Geometric Mindset {-}

# Geometric Duality {#duality}

In chapter [Data Matrix](#data-matrix) we talked about how a data table can be mathematically treated as a data matrix: typically as an array of individuals and variables. In this chapter we take a further step that should let you adopt a __geometrical mindset__. More specifically, you will learn how to think and look at any data matrix from a geometric standpoint. This is an incredible insightful concept which some authors refer to as the _duality_ of a data matrix. 


## Matrix Perspectives

It's very enlightening to think of a data matrix as viewed from the glass of Geometry. The key idea is to think of the data in a matrix as elements living in a multidimensional space. Actually, we can regard a data matrix from two apparently different perspectives that, in reality, are  intimately connected: the __rows perspective__ and the __columns perspective__. In order to explain these perspectives, let me use the following diagram of a data matrix $\mathbf{X}$ with $n$ rows and $p$ columns, with $x_{ij}$ representing the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.

```{r fig.cap='Duality of a data matrix', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/duality/data-perspectives.png")
```

When we look at a data matrix from the _columns_ perpective what we are doing is focusing on the $p$ variables. In a similar way, when looking at a data matrix from its _rows_ perspective, we are focusing on the $n$ individuals. This double perspective or __duality__ for short, is like the two sides of the same coin.


### Rows Space

We know that human vision is limited to three-dimensions, but pretend that you had superpowers that let you visualize a space with any number of dimensions. 

Because each row of the data matrix has $p$ elements, we can regard individuals as objects that live in a $p$-dimensional space. For visualization purposes, think of each variable as playing the role of a dimension associated to a given axis in this space; likewise, consider each of the $n$ individuals as being depicted as a point (or particle) in such space, like in the following diagram:

```{r fig.cap='Rows space', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/duality/rows-space.png")
```

In the figure above, even though I'm showing only three axes, you should pretend that you are visualizing a $p$-dimensional space (imaging that there are $p$ axes). Each point in this space corresponds to a single individual, and they all form what you can call a _cloud of points_.



### Columns Space

We can do the same visual exercise with the columns of a data matrix. Since each variable has $n$ elements, we can regard the set of $p$ variables as objects that live in an $n$-dimensional space. For convenient purposes, and in order to distinguish them from the individuals, we use an arrow (or vector) to graphically represent each variable:

```{r fig.cap='Columns space', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/duality/columns-space.png")
```

Analogously to the rows space and its cloud of individuals, you should also pretend that the image above is displaying an $n$-dimensional space with a bunch of blue arrows pointing in various directions.



### Toy Example

To make things less abstract, let's consider a toy $2 \times 2$ data matrix of _weight_ and _height_ values measured on two individuals: Leia and Luke. Here's the code in R to create a matrix `X` for this example:

```{r}
# toy matrix
X <- matrix(c(150, 172, 49, 77), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
rownames(X) <- c("Leia", "Luke")
colnames(X) <- c("weight", "height")

X
```

__Space of individuals__: If you look at the data in `X` from the individuals standpoint, each of them can be depicted as a dot in the 2-dimensional space spanned by variables `weight` and `height`:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.9}
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(140,180), ylim = c(40, 80), xaxs = "i")
abline(h = seq(from=45, to=80, by=5), col = "lightgray")
title(xlab = colnames(X)[1], ylab = colnames(X)[2])
segments(seq(150, 180, 10), rep(40, 4), seq(150, 180, 10), rep(80, 4), col = "lightgray")
axis(side = 1, pos = 40, at = seq(from=140, to=180, by=10), col = "gray20",  
     lwd.ticks = 0, cex.axis = 1, col.axis = "gray20", lwd = 1.5) 
axis(side = 2, at = seq(from=40, to=80, by=5), col = "gray20",  
     las = 2, lwd.ticks = 0, cex.axis = 1, col.axis = "gray20", lwd = 1.5)
points(X[,1], X[,2], pch = 19, col = "#4a86e8", cex = 2)
text(X[,1], X[,2], labels = rownames(X), col = "#4a86e8", cex = 1.2, pos = 2)
```


__Space of variables__: If you look at the data in `X` from the variables standpoint, each of them can be depicted as a vector in the 2-dimensional space spanned by `Leia` and `Luke`:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.9}
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0, 160), ylim = c(0, 180), xaxs = "i")
axis(side = 1, pos = 0, at = seq(from=0, to=160, by=20), col = "gray20",  
     lwd.ticks = 0, cex.axis = 1, col.axis = "gray20", lwd = 1.5) 
axis(side = 2, at = seq(from=0, to=180, by=20), col = "gray20",  
     las = 2, lwd.ticks = 0, cex.axis = 1, col.axis = "gray20", lwd = 1.5)
segments(seq(20, 160, 20), rep(0, 8), seq(20, 160, 20), rep(180, 8), col = "lightgray")
segments(rep(0, 9), seq(20, 180, 20), rep(160, 9), seq(20, 180, 20), col = "lightgray")
arrows(0, 0, 49, 77, lwd = 2, col = "#4a86e8", length = 0.1)
arrows(0, 0, 150, 172, lwd = 2, col = "#4a86e8", length = 0.1)
text(X[1,], X[2,], labels = colnames(X), col = "#4a86e8", cex = 1.2, pos = 2)
```



### Dual Space

The following figure illustrates the dual perspective of a data matrix. The standard convention is to represent __individuals as points__ in a $p$-dimensional space; and in turn represent __variables as vectors__ in an $n$-dimensional space.

```{r fig.cap='Rows and columns perspectives', echo = FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/duality/duality-diagram.png")
```
